This is a somewhat DOOM-like 3D engine based on the work by Ivaylo Beltchev and Emil Dotchevski.

[Original BOOM engine (archived, but source still downloadable)](http://web.archive.org/web/19991009204008/http://www.geocities.com:80/SiliconValley/Bay/3577/boom.html)

They didn't attach a license to their source, so I hope they don't mind me tampering with it.

## Roadmap

My intended changes to the original codebase:

* Make it compile in VS2017 / Windows 10 (done)
* Port the engine and demo to SDL2
* Improve code, fix bugs, use C++1x features, etc.
* Make it platform-agnostic, test on Linux
* Maybe port the editor to Qt, or make a new one (?)
* Add features
  * Sprites
  * Lighting
  * Backdrops
  * Animated textures
  * 2D elements
  * Resource management
  * Text
  * Sound
  * Scripting
  * Collision / visibility API
  * Some basic physics?
  * etc.

 I will never make it that far lol. This is just for fun.
